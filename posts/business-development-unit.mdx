SaMTEC focuses on Incremental Market-Driven Skills to empower students to perform better in the industry and create employment for themselves and others. Over the years, SaMTEC has invested knowledge and skills that empower its alumni to compete effectively in the job market.

A case in point is the Business Development Unit which boasts of over 80 percent employment rate among the students who completed their studies between 2013 and 2016.\
An evaluation carried out at the Business Development unit reveals that the BDU alumnus is in various sectors both in employment or self-employment. The majority of students who undertook courses in sewing have opened the business in the apparel industry.

A small section of both the BDU and SaMTEC graduands are pursuing higher education. Samtec has also invested in placement and internship, helping students access internship opportunities in the industry.

Since its inception in place in 2009, Sayid Mohamed technical education college (SaMTEC) has been operating under the umbrella of the NGO center for research and development (CeRID) education programme.  CERID played a big role in the progress of this wonderful college under the grand donor NCA that has laid the root foundation of the college in equipping and providing the endless and various requirements of the college to date.
